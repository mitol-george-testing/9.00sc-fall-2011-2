----------------

| ![Drawing of a smiley face.](BASEURL_PLACEHOLDER/resources/lec24_chp) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} This final lecture considers psychological perspectives on human nature (evolutionary psychology) and how to live our lives (happiness). For instance, to what extent do attitudes and behaviors about sex and race have evolutionary roots? Does more money, more vacation time, or more choice actually make us happier? Can we predict what things will make us happy, and act upon those predictions? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Keywords_: racism, sexuality, happiness, affective forecasting, paradox of choice, positive psychology {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Image: Public domain._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}
